\outl0\strokewidth0 \strokec2 Two studies have been cited by those claiming that the MMR vaccine causes autism. Both studies are critically flawed.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl340\sa280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b\fs28 \cf2 First study\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\sa240\partightenfactor0

\f0\b0\fs24 \cf2 In 1998, Andrew Wakefield and colleagues published a paper in the journal\'a0
\f2\i Lancet
\f0\i0 . Wakefield's hypothesis was that the {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.chop.edu/centers-programs/vaccine-education-center/vaccine-details/measles-mumps-and-rubella-vaccines"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine }}caused a series of events that include intestinal inflammation, entrance into the bloodstream of proteins harmful to the brain, and consequent development of autism. In support of his hypothesis, Dr. Wakefield described 12 children with developmental delay \'97 eight had autism. All of these children had intestinal complaints and developed autism within one month of receiving MMR.\
The Wakefield paper published in 1998 was flawed for two reasons:\

\outl0\strokewidth0 \strokec2 About 90% of children in England received MMR at the time this paper was written. Because MMR is administered at a time when many children are diagnosed with autism, it would be expected that most children with autism would have received an MMR vaccine, and that many would have received the vaccine recently. The observation that some children with autism recently received MMR is, therefore, expected. However, determination of whether MMR causes autism is best made by studying the incidence of autism in\'a0
\f1\b both
\f0\b0 \'a0vaccinated and unvaccinated children. This wasn't done.\
\ls1\ilvl0\kerning1\expnd0\expndtw0 \outl0\strokewidth0 {\listtext	2.	}\expnd0\expndtw0\kerning0
\outl0\strokewidth0 \strokec2 Although the authors claim that autism is a consequence of intestinal inflammation, intestinal symptoms were observed\'a0
\f1\b after
\f0\b0 , not before, symptoms of autism in all eight cases.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\sa240\partightenfactor0
\cf2 This study was subsequently retracted; in scientific terms, this means that the paper is not part of the scientific record because it was found to be based on scientific misconduct. In this case, the studies were deemed fraudulent and data misrepresented.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl340\sa280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b\fs28 \cf2 Second study\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\sa240\partightenfactor0

\f0\b0\fs24 \cf2 In 2002, Wakefield and coworkers published a second paper examining the relationship between measles virus and autism. The authors tested intestinal biopsy samples for the presence of measles virus from children with and without autism. Seventy-five of 91 children with autism were found to have measles virus in intestinal biopsy tissue as compared with only 5 of 70 patients who didn't have autism. On its surface, this was a concerning result. However, the second Wakefield paper was also critically flawed for the following reasons:\
\pard\tx220\tx720\pardeftab720\li720\fi-720\sl280\partightenfactor0
\ls2\ilvl0\cf2 \kerning1\expnd0\expndtw0 \outl0\strokewidth0 {\listtext	1.	}\expnd0\expndtw0\kerning0
\outl0\strokewidth0 \strokec2 Measles vaccine virus is live and attenuated. After inoculation, the vaccine virus probably replicates (or reproduces itself) about 15 to 20 times. Measles vaccine virus is likely to be taken up by specific cells responsible for virus uptake and presentation to the immune system (termed antigen-presenting cells or APCs). Because all APCs are mobile, and can travel throughout the body (including the intestine), it is plausible that a child immunized with MMR would have measles virus detected in intestinal tissues using a very sensitive assay. To determine if MMR is associated with autism, one must determine if the finding is\'a0
\f1\b specific
\f0\b0 \'a0for children with autism. Therefore, children with or without autism must be identical in two ways. First, children with or without autism must be matched for immunization status (i.e., receipt of the MMR vaccine). Second, children must be matched for the length of time between receipt of MMR vaccine and collection of biopsy specimens. Although this information was clearly available to the investigators and critical to their hypothesis, it was specifically omitted from the paper.\
\ls2\ilvl0\kerning1\expnd0\expndtw0 \outl0\strokewidth0 {\listtext	2.	}\expnd0\expndtw0\kerning0
\outl0\strokewidth0 \strokec2 Because natural measles virus is still circulating in England, it would have been important to determine whether the measles virus detected in these samples was natural measles virus or vaccine virus. Although methods are available to distinguish these two types of virus, the authors chose not to use them.\
\ls2\ilvl0\kerning1\expnd0\expndtw0 \outl0\strokewidth0 {\listtext	3.	}\expnd0\expndtw0\kerning0
\outl0\strokewidth0 \strokec2 The method used to detect measles virus in these studies was very sensitive. Laboratories that work with natural measles virus (such as the lab where these studies were performed) are at high risk of getting results that are incorrectly positive. No mention is made in the paper as to how this problem was avoided.\
\ls2\ilvl0\kerning1\expnd0\expndtw0 \outl0\strokewidth0 {\listtext	4.	}\expnd0\expndtw0\kerning0
\outl0\strokewidth0 \strokec2 As is true for all laboratory studies, the person who is performing the test should not know whether the sample is obtained from a case with autism or without autism (blinding). No statements were made in the methods section to assure that blinding occurred.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\sa240\partightenfactor0
\cf2 Several studies have been performed that disprove the notion that MMR causes autism.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl340\sa280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b\fs28 \cf2 Brent Taylor and co-workers\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\sa240\partightenfactor0

\f0\b0\fs24 \cf2 In 1999, Brent Taylor and co-workers examined the relationship between receipt of MMR and development of autism in an excellent, well-controlled study. Taylor examined the records of 498 children with autism or autism-like disorder.\
Cases were identified by registers from the North Thames region of England before and after the MMR vaccine was introduced into the United Kingdom in 1988. Taylor then examined the incidence and age at diagnosis of autism in vaccinated and unvaccinated children. He found that:\

\ls3\ilvl0\cf2 \kerning1\expnd0\expndtw0 \outl0\strokewidth0 {\listtext	1.	}\expnd0\expndtw0\kerning0
\outl0\strokewidth0 \strokec2 The percentage of children vaccinated was the same in children with autism as in other children in the North Thames region.\
\ls3\ilvl0\kerning1\expnd0\expndtw0 \outl0\strokewidth0 {\listtext	2.	}\expnd0\expndtw0\kerning0
\outl0\strokewidth0 \strokec2 No difference in the age of diagnosis of autism was found in vaccinated and unvaccinated children.\
\ls3\ilvl0\kerning1\expnd0\expndtw0 \outl0\strokewidth0 {\listtext	3.	}\expnd0\expndtw0\kerning0
\outl0\strokewidth0 \strokec2 The onset of symptoms of autism did not occur within two, four, or six months of receiving the MMR vaccine.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl340\sa280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b\fs28 \cf2 Madsen and colleagues\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\sa240\partightenfactor0

\f0\b0\fs24 \cf2 One of the best studies was performed by Madsen and colleagues in Denmark between 1991 and 1998 and reported in the\'a0
\f2\i New England Journal of Medicine
\f0\i0 . The study included 537,303 children representing 2,129,864 person-years of study. Approximately 82% of children had received the MMR vaccine. The group of children was selected from the Danish Civil Registration System, vaccination status was obtained from the Danish National Board of Health, and children with autism were identified from the Danish Central Register. The risk of autism in the group of vaccinated children was the same as that in unvaccinated children. Furthermore, there was no association between the age at the time of vaccination, the time since vaccination, or the date of vaccination and the development of autism.\
Subsequent studies and meta-analysis have corroborated the findings that the MMR vaccine does not cause autism.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl340\sa280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b\fs28 \cf2 Genetics\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\sa240\partightenfactor0

\f0\b0\fs24 \cf2 One of the best ways to determine whether a particular disease or syndrome is genetic is to examine the incidence in identical and fraternal twins. Using a strict definition of autism, among twins in which one has been diagnosed with autism, approximately 60% of the time an identical twin is also diagnosed, and 0% of the time is a fraternal twin diagnosed with autism. Using a broader definition of autism (i.e., autistic spectrum disorder), these rates rise to approximately 92% in identical twins and about 10% of the time when the twins are fraternal. Therefore, autism clearly has a genetic basis.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl340\sa280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b\fs28 \cf2 "Home-movie" studies\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\sa240\partightenfactor0

\f0\b0\fs24 \cf2 Clues to the causes of autism can be found in studies examining when the symptoms of autism are first evident. Perhaps the best data examining when symptoms of autism are first evident are the "home-movie studies. These studies took advantage of the fact that many parents take movies of their children during their first birthday (before they have received the MMR vaccine).\
Home movies from children who were eventually diagnosed with autism and those who were not diagnosed with autism were coded and shown to developmental specialists. Investigators were, with a very high degree of accuracy, able to separate autistic from non-autistic children at 1 year of age. These studies found that subtle symptoms of autism were present earlier than some parents had suspected, and that receipt of the MMR vaccine did not precede the first symptoms of autism. Other investigators extended the home-movie studies of 1-year-old children to include videotapes of children taken at 2 to 3 months of age.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl340\sa280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b\fs28 \cf2 Timing of first symptoms\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\sa240\partightenfactor0

\f0\b0\fs24 \cf2 Using a sophisticated movement analysis, videos from children eventually diagnosed with autism or not diagnosed with autism were coded and evaluated for their capacity to predict autism. Children who were eventually diagnosed with autism were predicted from movies taken in early infancy. This study supported the hypothesis that very subtle symptoms of autism are present in early infancy and argues strongly against vaccines as a cause of autism.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl340\sa280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b\fs28 \cf2 Structural abnormalities of the nervous system\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\sa240\partightenfactor0

\f0\b0\fs24 \cf2 Toxic or viral insults to the fetus that cause autism, as well as certain central nervous system disorders associated with autism, support the notion that autism is likely to occur in the womb. For example, children exposed to thalidomide during the first or early second trimester were found to have an increased incidence of autism. Thalidomide was a medication that used to be prescribed to pregnant women to treat nausea. However, autism occurred in children with ear, but not arm or leg, abnormalities. Because ears develop before 24 days gestation, and arms and legs develop after 24 days gestation, the risk period for autism following receipt of thalidomide must have been before 24 days gestation. In support of this finding, Rodier and colleagues found evidence for structural abnormalities of the nervous system in children with autism. These abnormalities could only have occurred during development of the nervous system in the womb.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl340\sa280\partightenfactor0

\f1\b\fs28 \cf2 Natural rubella infection\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\sa240\partightenfactor0

\f0\b0\fs24 \cf2 Similarly, children with congenital rubella syndrome are at increased risk for development of autism. Risk is associated with exposure to rubella before birth but not after birth.\
The following studies all support the fact that autism occurs during development of the nervous system early in the womb:\
